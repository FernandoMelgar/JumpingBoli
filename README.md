# JumpingBoli

Platform game using libGBX.

## Game Description
In this adventure, you are going to play Boli, a funny rounded ball that was captured in enemy territory only because they canâ€™t spin like it. You will need to jump through platforms rhythmically with some songs.
Your trip will start at the prison where they took you and with a lot of practice and effort, you may be able to escape from it. All of this while you avoid traps and try not to fall from jumping on the platforms. Prove yourself you are the fastest.
Keep your eyes on sound. How fast can you play?
